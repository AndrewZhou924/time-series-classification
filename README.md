# time-series-classification
short and long time series classification using convolutional neural networks

In this project, we present a novel framework for time series classification, which is based on Gramian Angular Summation/Difference Fields and Markov Transition Fields (GAF-MTF), a recently published image feature extraction method. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed as the classifier. This framework enables the use of CNN to learn high-level features and classify time series. Its performance was evaluated on 16 standard datasets. Experiment results show that our framework outperforms or achieves the same level at least with the GAF-MTF+Tiled CNN framework on 14 of the 16 datasets. And it obtained competitive performance compared with other 8 representive approaches. Furthermore, we compared the performance of GAF-MTF feature with other 5 image features on a large-scale cough dataset. Results indicates that the GAF-MTF feature is not suitable for large-scale cough datasets while its competitive performance on the standard datasets.
